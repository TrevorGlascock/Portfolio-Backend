# Portfolio
This my Portfolio's RESTful API. It exists merely as a means to demonstrate my ability to create backend endpoints, as well as to make my front-end portfolio significantly more scalable and easy to update with new projects. Whenever I need to update my projects for my portfolio, I simply edit the fixture, run the seed, test it in a DEV environement, and then run the same seed in a production environment, drastically reducing time spent on the front-end of my portfolio and allowing for quick and frequent changes.

## Current State
- Read-Only Projects Endpoint is fully functional.
- Backend is successfully connected to a DEV and PROD database that is accessed by the Front-End Portfolio.

### **`Todo:`**
- Add more projects to my Fixtures as my portfolio expands.
- Once the Front-end is fully functional, all content changes will happen at the database level, and the front-end will only change to accomodate a new style or aesthetic.
